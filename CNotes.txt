process of compiling c file
all to be written on one line in terminal
1 gcc call gcc compiler
2 name.c name of the file to compile
3 -o flag to put before the output name
4 name output name
5 -lm link math library?
6 -g adds symbols for debuggin
7 -Wall enables a set of warning messages that can help you identify potential issues in your code
8 -03 indicates optimization level 3 which tries every trick for building faster code
9 -std=gnu11 the standard to use? 


Passing a pointer to an array changes the array directly
passing an array creates a copy of the array
multi dimensional array needs to know all dimension except first example (int a[][3])
Strings are not mutable but strings declared as arrays are

print size_t with %zu strlen(string) string length

error checking tools
lint, debuggers, leak finders, bound checkers.

Steps of running a c program
Preprocessor, obeys commands that start with # which are called directives, which adds things to the program
they don't end with a semicolon
linking: library functions are added to the program
Whats a makefile?  It's not part of the C programming language but rather part of the operating system or more specifically the shell according to my current understanding. It's a configuration file that specifies how to build an executable program or file.It defines rules and dependencies between files automating the build process


make file built in variables
$@ the full file target name.
$* the target file with the suffice cut off
$< the name of the file that caused this target to get triggered and made.

show default rules
make -p -f /dev/null

ldflags vs ldlibs

Printing to screen and conversion specification
printf: function for displaying a string also called format string. a format string can contain characters as well as "conversion specifications" these are characters that begin with %. it represents a value to be filled in during printing

%c character
%d for signed integer
%f for float
%i signed integer
%e exponential format
%g exponential or fixed decimal format

examples
%5d number will be printed with 5 characters min
%.2f number will be printed with 2 numbers after decimal
%10.3f number will be printed with 10 characters overall and min of 3 right justified
%-5d left justified

escape sequences \
\a alert
\b backspace
\n newline
\horizontal tab

to print % use double %%
scanf is for getting input from the user
& precedes each variable in a scanf call
example: scanf("%d%f", &i,&j) %d gets stored into i and %f gets stored into j
you can include characters to be expected in the input such as "/"
example: scanf("%d/%d", &i,&j)

operators
/ with integers will cut off fractional part
% gives remainder. Requires integers. With anything else will not compile
good to use parenthesis but c does follow operator rules
left associative (*, /,%, +,-)
right associative( unary operator +,-, =)
that is  i=j=k=0 means i=(j=(k=0))


Implementation defined behaviour
behaviour that depends on the compiler used
should be documented

Lvalues
variables are lvalues: objects stored in computer memory not from a computation
